## Walker Node Positioning Algorithm

This is a Python implementation of John Q. Walker II's node-positioning
algorithm for general trees with some adjustments and additional methods.

Included is the original report that this project is based on, provided by the University of North Carolina:\
[A Node-Positioning Algorithm for General Trees](89-034.pdf)

Note: there are select comments marked with NB (nota bene), which call to attention
parts of the algorithm that differ from the original specification because something did not work as expected without those changes. The majority of the algorithm should otherwise be as prescribed in the report.

While this project carries an MIT license, all rights and restrictions ultimately defer to those dictated by the original research work.
