# Walker Node Positioning Algorithm (python)

This is a Python implementation of John Q. Walker II's node-positioning
algorithm for general trees with some adjustments and additional methods.

Original paper: http://www.cs.unc.edu/techreports/89-034.pdf

Note: there are select comments marked with NB (nota bene), which call to attention
parts of the algorithm that differ from the original specification because the original
specification appeared to be wrong in those places. The changes made in these parts
were necessary for the algorithm to work as far as I could tell, so it is assumed that
these were typos in the original paper.
